I enjoy playing spider solitaire and have been playing for decades with [Spider Solitaire by PeopleFun](https://appadvice.com/app/spider-solitaire/500962489) on my iPhone. In 2021, I decided to challenge myself to consecutive wins. So I reset my statistics and began not to abandon every single game. And I achieved 1000 wins in a row at Expert level (4 suits).

Among the solitaire games, spider solitaire is one of the hardest games to win. It took several years for me to get 50% wins. The winning chances of a good player are considered to be about 1 in 3 games. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)). [According to a research](https://www.tranzoa.net/~alex/plspider.htm), 2 out of 32000 games are not winnable. I was lucky not to have such games during my challenge. I am keeping challenging myself to see how far I can go. 

This is the screen shot of the 1000 wins.

The most challenging game took 8 hours and 5671 moves to win, where I had to undo thousands of times.
